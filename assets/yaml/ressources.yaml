          <h5>Welcome ! üëã üòÑ </h5>
          The members of Bavelier lab extend a warm welcome to you from Geneva! We are very grateful that you're interested in our experiment!<br>
          This short tutorial will go over the mechanics of the task to make sure everything is clear before you start!<br><br>
          <h5>General description</h5>
          The goal of the task is to predict where different animals are going to appear next based on their current position. Using your keyboard you will select among four positions on the screen.<br>
          You will go through <b>six levels</b> of increasing difficulty. Four levels with four different wolves (grey, yellow, blue and red),
          then a level with a rabbit, then a final level with the fourth wolf (red).<br>
          The last three levels will be different and you will go through another short tutorial before starting the 4th level.<br>
          Most trials will consist of an observation phase and prediction phase.<br>
          The task will last between ‚è±<b>1 and 2 hours</b>‚è±, depending on the breaks you may take.<br><br>

          <h5>Bienvenue ! üëã üòÑ </h5>
          Les membres de Bavelier lab vous remercier chaleureusement ! Nous sommes tr√®s reconnaissants de votre int√©r√™t pour votre exp√©rience!
          Ce court tutoriel examinera la m√©canique de la t√¢che pour s'assurer que tout soit clair avant de commencer!
          <h5>Description g√©n√©rale</h5>
          Le but de la t√¢che est de regarder comment un loup se d√©place sur quatre positions de l'√©cran et de pr√©dire l'endroit o√π il va appara√Ætre ensuite en utilisant le clavier.
          Chaque essai sera compos√© d'une phase d'observation et la plupart du temps une phase de pr√©diction.
          Vous traverserez quatre niveaux de difficult√© croissante.
          La t√¢che dure entre 1 et 2 heures selon les pauses que vous prendrez.

          <h5>Observation phase</h5>
          When a trial starts, you will first observe the position of the wolf for a second before he disappears.
          There will then be a short delay period when you do not need to do anything.
          During this phase, the center dot will be surrounded by a full square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/fullSquare.svg'></center>
          <br><br>
          <h5>Prediction phase</h5>
          Then the surrounding square will change to a dotted square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquare.svg'></center>
          <br>
          This change marks the start of the prediction phase. As soon as you see this dotted square you will have to predict the next position of the wolf based on where he was previously.
          Predict as fast as you can. Your predictions will be made with key presses, which we will review shortly.
          <br>
          After making a prediction, you will wait briefly until the wolf appears in his new position.
          <br>
          <b>Failing to give a response 5 times in a row will pause the task and risk disqualifying you from the task!</b>
          <br>

  fourLevels:
    title: { en: 'Task Structure: Six Levels' }
    content:
      en: >
          <h5>The levels</h5>
          There will be <b>SIX levels</b> in this task, the first three levels are relatively short and will last around 10 minutes each.
          During the levels 4 5 and 6, the animals will be slower, but each level will also last around 10 minutes.
          <br><br>
          <h5>Breaks</h5>
          You cannot pause the game during levels. If you open another page/program, or if you do not respond after a while, the game will pause.
          <b>If the game is paused for longer than 30 seconds total for a level, you will be disqualified from the task.</b><br><br>
          Breaks are allowed between levels, but these breaks must not exceed 15 minutes!<br> This is because we want all our participants to complete this task in similar conditions.
          Longer pauses may have a strong impact on your ability to learn during the task and may affect our results in unpredictable ways.
          <br><br>
          Completing the task will take 1-2 hours, depending on how long your breaks are.<br><br>


  progressInstruction:
    title: { en: 'Level Progress' }
    content:
      en: >
          During each level, as you progress, you will see a white line growing around the center square.
          When the line form a full square the level will be finished:
          <br><br>
            <center><img width="20" height="20" src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquareWithCenterLoader.gif'></center>
          <br>


  keyboardInstruction:
    title: { en: 'Keyboard Input' }
    content:
      en: >
          During the prediction phase, you will use your keyboard to respond where you think the wolf will appear next.
          Use the following four keys for your responses:
          <br>
          <center><img src="./assets/sprites/keyboard/fullsize_color_legend.png"></center>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>D - to pick the top left position</li>
            <li>C - to pick the bottom left position</li>
            <li>K - to pick the top right position</li>
            <li>M - to pick the bottom right position</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

  fmriIntro:
    title: { en: 'Last Level' }
    content:
      en: >
          Congratulations for finishing the first three parts!
          <br><br>
          For this last level, it will be <b>slower</b> than the previous levels and will last around 30min.<br>
          It is <b>not a bug</b>, and the goal remains the same: predict the next position correctly! <br>
          Because it is slower, the task is split into <b>three "blocks"</b> of 50 trials. You can take a short break of 5 minutes between each block.<br>
          <br>

  fmriRabbit:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Catch The Rabbit'}
    content:
      en: >
          During this level you will have a first block of 50 trials where you will have to catch a Wolf, then a block of 50 trials where you will have ot catch a <b>Rabbit</b>, and finally another block of 50 trials
          where you wll have to catch the wolf again.
          The two wolves in this level are the same. On the other hand the rabbit does not behave like the wolf; it will be your job to figure out how to best predict its next position.<br>
          You will go through a short tutorial so that you can familiarize yourself with the rabbit.<br>
          The rabbit will appear in the <b>second block</b>, and you will have to predict its next position for 50 trials.


  fmriDelay:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Delays' }
    content:
      en: >
          Another new change is that you will not predict right after observing the new position of the animal.<br>
          The animal will appear for a short time, and then disappear. You will have to wait a short delay before making a prediction.<br>
          As before, the signal for you to hit a response key will be given by the center square changing to a dotted square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquare.svg'></center>
          <br>

  lockedCross:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Locked State' }
    content:
      en: >
          Unlike previous levels, after the prediction time is over, you will be put into a short "locked state".
          <br>During this state you will not be able to make any predictions, and you will have to wait until the wolf/rabbit appears at the next position.<br>
            In locked mode, the center square will be an empty square if you did not make a prediction:
            <br>
              <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/fullSquare.svg'></center>
            <br><br>
            Or it will display a square in the position you picked. For example, here it is locked to the top-left:
            <br>
              <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/lockedTopLeft.svg'></center>
            <br><br>


  fmriNoPrediction:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Trials Without Prediction' }
    content:
      en: 'On some of the trials you will not be asked to answer. The central square will stay with a solid border, and the wolf or rabbit will move without any prediction phase.'
