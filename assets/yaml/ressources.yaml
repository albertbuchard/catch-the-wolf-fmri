          <h5>Welcome ! üëã üòÑ </h5>
          The members of Bavelier lab extend a warm welcome to you from Geneva! We are very grateful that you're interested in our experiment!<br>
          This short tutorial will go over the mechanics of the task to make sure everything is clear before you start!<br><br>
          <h5>General description</h5>
          The goal of the task is to look at how a wolf moves between four positions of the screen,
          and to predict where it is going to appear next with your keyboard.<br>
          Most trials will consist of an observation phase and prediction phase.<br>
          You will go through <b>four levels</b> of increasing difficulty.<br>
          The task will last between ‚è±<b>1 and 2 hours</b>‚è±, depending on the breaks you may take.<br><br>

          <h5>Bienvenue ! üëã üòÑ </h5>
          Les membres de Bavelier lab vous remercier chaleureusement ! Nous sommes tr√®s reconnaissants de votre int√©r√™t pour votre exp√©rience!
          Ce court tutoriel examinera la m√©canique de la t√¢che pour s'assurer que tout soit clair avant de commencer!
          <h5>Description g√©n√©rale</h5>
          Le but de la t√¢che est de regarder comment un loup se d√©place sur quatre positions de l'√©cran et de pr√©dire l'endroit o√π il va appara√Ætre ensuite en utilisant le clavier.
          Chaque essai sera compos√© d'une phase d'observation et la plupart du temps une phase de pr√©diction.
          Vous traverserez quatre niveaux de difficult√© croissante.
          La t√¢che dure entre 1 et 2 heures selon les pauses que vous prendrez.

  trialInstruction:
    title: { en: 'Trial Structure: Observation and Prediction' }

          <h5>Observation phase</h5>
          When a trial starts, you will first observe the position of the wolf for a second before he disappears.
          There will then be a short delay period when you do not need to do anything.
          During this phase, the center dot will be surrounded by a full square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/fullSquare.svg'></center>
          <br><br>
          <h5>Prediction phase</h5>
          Then the surrounding square will change to a dotted square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquare.svg'></center>
          <br>
          This change marks the start of the prediction phase. As soon as you see this dotted square you will have to predict the next position of the wolf
          as fast as you can. Your predictions will be made with key presses, which we will review shortly.
          <br>
          After making a prediction, you will wait briefly until the wolf appears in his new position.
          <br>
          <b>Failing to give a response 5 times in a row will disqualify you from the task!</b>
          <br>

  fourLevels:
    title: { en: 'Task Structure: Four Levels' }
    content:
      en: >
          <h5>The levels</h5>
          There will be <b>four levels</b> in this task, the first three levels are relatively short and will last around 10 minutes each.
          The fourth level will be slower, and it will last around 30 minutes.
          <br><br>
          <h5>Breaks</h5>
          You cannot pause the game during levels. If you open another page/program, or if you do not respond after a while, the game will pause itself.
          <b>If the game is paused for longer than 30 seconds total for a level, you will be disqualified from the task.</b><br>
          Breaks are allowed between levels, but long pauses may have a strong
          and uncontrollable impact on your ability to learn during the task; they may affect our results in unpredictable ways.
          This is why we can only allow breaks up to 15 minutes.<br><br>
          Completing the task will take 1-2 hours, depending on how long your breaks are.<br><br>


  progressInstruction:
    title: { en: 'Level Progress' }
    content:
      en: >
          During each level you can see your progress through the progress indicator around the center square.
          As you progress, the square will gradually get fuller:
          <br><br>
            <center><img width="20" height="20" src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquareWithLoader.gif'></center>
          <br>


  keyboardInstruction:
    title: { en: 'Keyboard Input' }
    content:
      en: >
          During the prediction phase, you will use your keyboard to respond where you think the wolf will appear next.
          Use the following four keys for your responses:
          <br>
          <center><img src="./assets/sprites/keyboard/fullsize_color_legend.png"></center>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>D - to pick the top left position</li>
            <li>C - to pick the bottom left position</li>
            <li>K - to pick the top right position</li>
            <li>M - to pick the bottom right position</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          OK. You will now try a short sequence of trials so you can familiarize yourself with the task.

  fmriIntro:
    title: { en: 'Last Level' }
    content:
      en: >
          Congratulations for finishing the first three parts!
          <br><br>
          For this last level, it will be slower than the previous levels.<br>
          It is not a bug, and the goal remains the same: predict the next position correctly! <br>
          Because it is slower, the task is split into <b>three "blocks"</b> of 50 trials. You can take a short break of 5 minutes between each block.<br>
          <br>

  fmriRabbit:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Catch The Rabbit'}
    content:
      en: >
          You will sometimes have to catch a <b>rabbit</b>!
          The rabbit does not behave like the wolf; it will be your job to figure out how to best predict its next position.<br>
          You will go through a short tutorial so that you can familliarize yourself with the rabbit.<br>
          The rabbit will appear in the <b>second block</b>, and you will have to predict its movement for 50 trials.


  fmriDelay:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Delays' }
    content:
      en: >
          Another new change is that you will not predict right after observing the new position of the wolf/rabbit.<br>
          The wolf/rabbit will appear for a short time, and then disappear. You will have to wait a short delay before making a prediction.<br>
          As before, the signal for you to hit a response key will be given by the center square changing to a dotted square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/predictionSquare.svg'></center>
          <br>

  lockedCross:
    title: { en: 'New Feature: Locked State' }
    content:
      en: >
          Unlike previous levels, after the prediction time is over, you will be put into a short "locked state".
          <br>During this state you will not be able to make any predictions, and you will have to wait until the wolf/rabbit appears at the next position.<br>
            In locked mode, the center square will be an empty square if you did not make a prediction:
            <br>
              <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/fullSquare.svg'></center>
            <br><br>
            Or it will display a square in the position you picked. For example, here it is locked to the top-left:
            <br>
              <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/lockedTopLeft.svg'></center>
            <br><br>

    title: { en: 'New Feature: Trials Without Prediction' }
    content:
